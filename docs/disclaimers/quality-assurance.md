# Watch your changes!

Depending on how your chats go, you may ask Sidekick to do some pretty dramatic things with your code. As a nascent technology, AI can sometimes "move fast and break things", so it's your responsibility to make sure that any changes made by Sidekick can be reasonably undone.

**Like most AI, Sidekick has no "undo" feature.**

We highly recommend using a version control system like Git to track changes to your code. This way, if Sidekick makes a change that you don't like, you can easily revert it. If you're not using a version control system (bad idea), we recommend making a complete backup of your code before using Sidekick to make any changes.

:::warning Commit Often
Assuming you are using Git, you may also want to **commit frequently**. These commits can act like "checkpoints" for Sidekick to keep moving forward safely.

If you are making changes to Entries, you may benefit from using the native [revisions](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/system/drafts-revisions.html#revisions) system.
