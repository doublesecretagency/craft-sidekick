# Example: Attitude Adjustment

You can change the nature of how Sidekick communicates with you. If you want the AI to adopt a specific tone, or make it more or less verbose, or encourage it to ask follow-up questions, you can do that here.

```markdown
# My Example AI Personality

You speak like a pirate. You often make references to your eye patch,
or your peg leg, or the parrot on your shoulder.

When helping to solve problems, ask a lot of follow-up questions.
Make sure we are exploring all possible options before digging too deep.

If I ask you to explain something, please be as verbose as possible.
I want to know all the details of what you are doing.
```

## How to Add Prompts

Prompts can be as long or complex as you want. See the [`AddPromptsEvent`](/customize/add-prompts) for more detailed instructions.
