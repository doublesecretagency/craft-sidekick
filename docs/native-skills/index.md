# Native Skills

Sidekick currently boasts a small but powerful set of skills, packaged directly into the plugin. If you need something beyond what is shown here, it's very easy to create your own [custom skills](/custom-skills/).

## Templates

By reviewing and updating the files and directories in your `templates` folder, Sidekick can manage the general look and feel of your website.

- **Can review the directory and file structure of the `templates` folder.**
- **Can create a new directory or file with specified content.**
- **Can read an existing file.**
- **Can update an existing file with specified content.**
- **Can delete a specified file or empty directory.**

## Entries

Sidekick's entry management skills are still very rudimentary.

- **Can create a new entry.**

## Settings - Sections

If you're feeling brave, you can ask Sidekick to create or manage your Sections. **Be extremely careful**, as AI can occasionally make mistakes, and you don't want to make an error that cannot be undone.

- **Can get a complete list of existing sections.**
- **Can create a new section.**
- **Can delete a section (requires confirmation).**
