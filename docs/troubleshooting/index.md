# Troubleshooting Tips

## Don't panic!

It's perfectly natural for Sidekick to experience a few missteps along the way. If you see a red "Error" message, don't worry! Sidekick will review the error message (including a hidden stack trace) to try to get a better sense of what went wrong. If possible, it will automatically make adjustments and try again.

## Ask for more information

When reading an error, you can ask Sidekick for additional details. For example, you can say _"show me the stack trace for that error"_ to get a better sense of where the problem is originating from.

If Sidekick failed to add or update something, you can ask _"what JSON config did you use?"_ to see the exact data it tried to save.

## "Clear Conversation" often helps

Sometimes you need to "turn it off and back on again", which for Sidekick means to **clear the conversation**. If you repeatedly encounter strange errors, try clearing the chat window to get a fresh start.

## Slow down, break requests into smaller pieces

You may be trying to take too many actions at once. If Sidekick trips up when trying to do a big job, it's probably a sign to break the assignment into smaller pieces. Be as granular as needed to keep Sidekick on track.

## Reporting issues
