# Chat Window

Sidekick adds an AI chat window to the Craft control panel for editing Twig files and managing entries, fields, and sections. In the main sidebar navigation of the control panel, click the **Sidekick** link to open the chat window.

## Message Types

The chat window displays different types of messages, each color-coded for clarity:

| Color                                   | Message Type           | Description                           |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Black                                   | **User Messages**      | Your own inputs.                      |
| Black                                   | **Assistant Messages** | Responses from Sidekick and OpenAI.   |
| <span style="color:#127fbf">Blue</span> | **System Messages**    | System actions performed by Sidekick. |
| <span style="color:#d81e23">Red</span>  | **Error Messages**     | Alerts when something goes wrong.     |

## Clearing the Conversation

Clicking the "Clear Conversation" button will **erase the current conversation** and **start a fresh chat**. This is useful when you want to change the subject, or just feel like you need to start over.

It's an excellent first step when troubleshooting an issue. Sometimes you have to "turn it off and back on again", and this is how it's done in Sidekick.
