# Troubleshooting

If you see Sidekick spit out a red "Error" message, don't panic!

Sidekick will review the error message (including a hidden stack trace) to try to get a better sense of what went wrong. If possible, it will automatically make adjustments and try again.

## "Clear Conversation" often helps

Sometimes you need to "turn it off and back on again", which for Sidekick means to **clear the conversation**. If you repeatedly encounter strange errors, try clearing the chat window to get a fresh start.

## Slow down, break requests into smaller pieces

You may be trying to take too many actions at once. If Sidekick trips up when trying to do a big job, it's probably a sign to break the assignment into smaller pieces. Be as granular as needed to keep Sidekick on track.

## Reporting issues

AI is still young, as is Sidekick. If you repeatedly encounter any inexplicable errors, please **take a screenshot** and [report it to us](https://www.doublesecretagency.com/contact). We want to make Sidekick better for you!
