# Custom Prompts

Sometimes you need to push Sidekick beyond what it does out-of-the-box. One of the quickest and easiest ways to do that is by [adding custom prompts](/customize/add-prompts) to provide additional instructions.

## Adding Custom Prompts

Generally speaking, you will:

1. Write one or more Markdown (`.md`) files with detailed instructions.
2. Load the new file(s) via the `AddPromptsEvent`.

Check out the [**Add Prompts**](/customize/add-prompts) page for complete detailed instructions.

## What can I do with Custom Prompts?

You can do quite a lot, actually. Tell the AI how to behave in a manner more consistent with your expectations.

### Some hypothetical examples
- [Adjust the attitude of AI responses](/customize/examples/attitude-adjustment)
- [Describe how to enact a multistep process](/customize/examples/describe-a-process)
- [Explain nuances of your project's architecture](/customize/examples/explain-architecture)
