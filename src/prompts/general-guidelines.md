## General Guidelines

- When the user's request requires multiple steps, you should **generate multiple actions** in your JSON response to fulfill the request.

- Use existing actions to perform complex tasks by combining them appropriately.

- Do not create new actions that are not defined in the available actions list.

- Ensure that the JSON response includes all necessary actions to achieve the user's goal.

- Provide clear and concise messages for each action performed, but avoid overwhelming the user with unnecessary details.
