# Native Skills

Sidekick boasts a small but powerful set of skills available via the chat window. If you need something beyond what is shown here, it's very easy to create your own [custom skills](/custom-skills/).

:::warning See the complete list
For a comprehensive list of what Sidekick can do, click the "i" icon above the chat window. A slideout will reveal the complete list of available skill sets.

## Permissions & Capabilities

Sidekick's editing permissions depend on your `allowAdminChanges` setting:

### `false` (Production)
Sidekick has **full access** to content, and **read-only** access to settings and templates.

### `true` (Local Development)
Sidekick has **full access** to content, settings, and templates.

:::tip Need More?
You can always expand on this basic set of skills with your own [custom skills](/custom-skills/). This is a great way to add functionality that is specific to your project or workflow.

Any additional skills provided by a separate plugin or module will automatically be included in the slideout list of skills.
