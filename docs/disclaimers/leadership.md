# You are still in charge.

It is important to recognize that **you are the human** and Sidekick is... well, your sidekick. This tool is merely an assistant, a utility for getting your job done more quickly and easily.

## Be specific

If you give it vague instructions (ie: "make the homepage look better"), it will do a moderate job of improving the homepage. You'll get better results if you give it more specific instructions (ie: "round the corners of all images and increase the spacing around the main content").

If you tell Sidekick to come up with wild and crazy ideas, it will. But you, the human, will be stuck with the results. Be careful when authorizing Sidekick to make too many decisions on your behalf.

## Take your time

We recommend that you **move slowly**, splitting your requests into smaller, more bite-sized pieces. Make your requests clear and specific, and be sure to review the results before moving on to the next step. This will help you avoid any potential pitfalls and ensure that you get the most out of your experience with Sidekick.

:::tip Technical Limitations
In this early stage of development, it is still possible for Sidekick to get overwhelmed by overly complex requests. While the AI correctly understands the question, the resulting response may force the system to take too many actions at once.

If this happens to you, slow down and take it piece by piece!
