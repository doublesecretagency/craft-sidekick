# Sidekick plugin for Craft CMS

**Your AI companion for rapid Craft CMS development.**

---

## What Is It?

Sidekick is a fully-integrated AI companion for editing and updating Craft CMS. With direct access to template files, entries, and various settings, Sidekick can streamline your development process.

### Chat Window

You can talk to Sidekick via the [chat window](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/chat-window/), using plain language requests to manage code and content. Sidekick boasts a healthy set of [native skills](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/native-skills/), and you can easily add your own [custom skills](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/custom-skills/) with a module or separate plugin.

### AI Summary Field Type

The relatively simple [AI Summary field](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/fields/ai-summary) allows you to automatically summarize the content of a single element. The content can be summarized manually, or when each element is saved.

## AI Providers

Sidekick currently supports [Open AI](https://openai.com), with planned support for both [Claude](https://github.com/doublesecretagency/craft-sidekick/issues/1) and [Gemini](https://github.com/doublesecretagency/craft-sidekick/issues/2) in the future.
