### AI Chat Window

You can talk to Sidekick via the [chat window](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/chat/how-it-works), using plain language requests to manage code and content. Sidekick boasts a healthy set of [native skills](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/chat/native-skills), and you can easily add your own [custom skills](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/chat/custom-skills) with a module or separate plugin.

### "AI Summary" Field Type

The relatively simple [AI Summary](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/sidekick/fields/ai-summary) field type uses AI to summarize the content of a single element. The content can be summarized manually, or automatically when each element is saved.
